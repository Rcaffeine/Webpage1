What is the best car?

By this I mean historically, encompassing 140 years.

There are so many factors to take into account:
the family car, the power, the thrill, the sport.

The family car can be a 21st century SUV, or a 1940s "tin can", 
or a Land Rover, or a 2 CV.
Powerwise, we are talking F1, or GP car.
Sportswise, Rallying or F1.

I was talking to a neighbour who owns a 1940s Harley. We agreed 
that car design stopped being interesting in 2000.
Let's not go into details.

Power-wise, what is more exciting? A post-2000 WRC car, 
a pre-2007 F1, a pre-airfoil or post-airfoil GP car?

WRC cars are interesting, but an 80s Rally has "de la gueule".
A pre-airfoil GP or a shrill 2005 F1 V8?

Sportswise, a pre Health-and-Safety GP (Phewww! About time!), 
an 80s Rally, a 90s F1 GP?
