<b>What is the best car?
</b>
<br>
 By this I mean historically, encompassing 140 years.
<br>
There are so many factors to take into account: <br>
the family car, the power, the thrill, the sport.
<br><br>

The family car can be a 21st century SUV, or a 1940s "tin can", 
or a Land Rover, or a 2 CV.
<br>
Powerwise, we are talking F1, or GP car. <br>
Sportswise, Rallying or F1.
<br>
<br>
I was talking to a neighbour who owns a 1940s Harley. We agreed 
that car design stopped being interesting in 2000.
<br>
Let's not go into details.
<br><br>
Power-wise, what is more exciting? A post-2000 WRC car, 
a pre-2007 F1, a pre-airfoil or post-airfoil GP car?
<br>
<br>
WRC cars are interesting, but an 80s Rally has "de la gueule".
<br>
A pre-airfoil GP or a shrill 2005 F1 V10?
<br>
<br>

Sportswise, a pre Health-and-Safety GP (Phewww! About time!), 
an 80s Rally, a 90s F1 GP?
<br>

<br>
Let's ponder.
<br>
<br>
Take care.
